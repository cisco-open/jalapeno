# Getting Started

This section contains instructions for setting up Jalapeno. This application is built using microservices on top of a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster.

General system recommendations can be found in the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)

If you have no K8s environment running, start with installing [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md).

Already have a K8s environment? Feel free to jump straight into [Installing Jalapeno](jalapeno.md).

Curious about the project architecture & components? Head back to the [About](../about/index.md) section.
