# Prerequisites

Jalapeno has been primarily developed, tested, and operated on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 Kubernetes environments (bare-metal, VM, or cloud).

Recommended VM sizing for a test lab is 4 vCPU, 16GB memory, and 50G of disk.

If deploying in production or a test environment with large table sizes (full Internet table, 250k + internal or vpn prefixes), then we recommend a bare metal K8s cluster with two or more nodes.
