# Repository details

### Docker Repository
We have created two Docker V2 Artifactory repositories for you. You can find the details below.  

Repo name : **gspie-docker** & **gspie-dev-docker**  

nsa-registry-dev-docker is a development snapshot repo which you can use to store your development artifacts. This dev repo will have regular clean up every 3 months as per our purge policy. Any unused artifact older than 3 months will be deleted and nsa-registry is a release repo where you will be storing all your releases.

### Generic Binary Repository

Here are the three repositories, use these URLs for uploads (_for generic binaries like XRv images_)

- Release Repo: http://engci-maven.cisco.com/artifactory/generic-release
- Snapshot Repo: http://engci-maven.cisco.com/artifactory/generic-snapshot
- Thirdparty Repo: http://engci-maven.cisco.com/artifactory/generic-thirdparty

The Release repo stores release artifacts, the Snapshot repo stores development artifacts, and the Thirdparty repo is used for storing any outside build dependencies your software needs.

**Use this URL for downloads**

Virtual Repo (above three repos combined): http://engci-maven.cisco.com/artifactory/generic-group

If you have any questions about using the application please do not hesitate to contact us via engit-ci-support@cisco.com â€“ I would also be glad to meet with you over Webex if needed to discuss any details.
