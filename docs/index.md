# Welcome to Project Jalapeno

## *A cloud-native infrastructure platform to enable development of network services*

Project Jalapeno combines existing open source tools with services and capabilities we've developed into an infrastructure platform intended to enable development of SDN control plane applications.  Our goal: give developers the ability to quickly and easily build SDN control applications on top of a common data collection and warehousing infrastructure (Jalapeno).

This website provides documentation and shell scripts to install Jalapeno's component images.
