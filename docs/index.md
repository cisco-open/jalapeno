# Welcome to Project Jalapeno

## *A cloud-native infrastructure platform to enable development of network services*

Project Jalapeno combines existing open source tools with some new stuff we've developed into an infrastructure platform intended to enable development of Cloud Native Network Services (CNNS).  Think of it as applying microservices architecture to SDN: give developers the ability to quickly and easily build microservice control planes (CNNS) on top of a common data collection and warehousing infrastructure (Jalapeno).

This website provides documentation and shell scripts to install Jalapeno's component images.

Check out [Getting Started](install/gettingstarted.md) to set up Jalapeno on your own systems.
