The following systems are allocated for IE use.

sandbox8 - current harmony/voltron virtual lab
sandbox9 - current harmony/voltron virtual lab
bruce-dev1 - current harmony/voltron virtual lab and Bruceâ€™s labs
gojira - IE infrastructure - jenkins1
naja - IE developer virtual labs and development workspaces - karthik-dev1, aishsree-dev1, launcher, swarm-master
yoda - IE VMWare ESXi server

There is capacity on gojira for virtual labs. The plan is to create systems for all IE developers on naja. The IE team may want to use gojira instead of naja for this purpose. The graphs at this link show the current load on all IE systems except yoda.

All systems except for yoda are shown in Ganglia and organized by group. Dipesh did not install the ganglia agent when he installed ESXi and I do not have access to this server.

development - architecture team servers minus bruce-dev1 which was transferred to IE
gojira-guest - IE virtual hosts on gojira
infrastructure - infrastructure servers - varan, obiwan, etc.
innovationedge - IE servers, except yoda
naja-guest - IE virtual hosts on naja
obiwan-guest - Infrstructure virtual hosts on obiwan
pnda - Hadoop/PNDA cluster servers
sandbox - General user sandbox servers minus sandbox8/9 which were transferred to IE
traffic - Traffic generation servers
varan-guest - Infrastructure virtual hosts on varan

Performance graphs for all lab hosts can be seen here.
