And network topologies (whether real or virtual) can be modeled as graphs. Thus, if we think in terms of graphs, we can address any topological use case as an exercise in database mapping. With this framework in mind, Jalapeno has the theoretical ability to address any kind of virtual topology use case, for example:</p> <ul> <li>Internal Traffic Engineering (TE) - engineered tunnels traversing a network under common management (BGP-LS use cases - see note below)</li> <li>Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) - engineered tunnels sending traffic out a specific egress router/interface to an external network</li> <li>SD-WAN - various combinations of TE and EPE</li> <li>VPN Overlays / Segmentation - engineered tunnels creating point-to-point or multipoint overlay virtual networks</li> <li>Network Slicing - add some SLA to VPN overlays</li> <li>VPN Overlays with TE, EPE, SDWAN - various combinations of Overlay and TE services</li> <li>Service Chaining - engineered tunnels, potentially a series of them, linked together via or seamlessly traversing midpoint service nodes</li> <li>Service Meshes - generally a service-mesh is more of a layer-7 graph, but the mesh could be augmented with some layer-3 topological service as well</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#some-project-principles-and-goals","title":"Some project principles and goals","text":"<ul> <li>Use-case, topology, and endpoint agnostic - The host, hypervisor, CNI, or other endpoint may be the control/encapsulation point (linux, fd.io, eBPF, etc.)</li> <li>Give applications the ability to directly choose their network SDN service or SLA</li> <li>Enable development of an ecosystem of SDN control applications, tools, and capabilities</li> <li>Modular, extensible, microservice architecture</li> <li>Emphasize the use of APIs over Protocols for greater agility</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#key-components","title":"Key Components","text":"<p>Jalapeno is comprised of a series of microservices which can be summarized as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Collectors</p> <ul> <li>Capture network topology and performance data and feed the data to Kafka.
