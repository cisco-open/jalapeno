.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR "\-V" , " -Version"
print the version of the
.B bridge
utility and exit.

.TP
.BR "\-s" , " \-stats", " \-statistics"
output more information. If this option
is given multiple times, the amount of information increases.
As a rule, the information is statistics or some time values.

.TP
.BR "\-d" , " \-details"
print detailed information about MDB router ports.

.TP
.BR "\-n" , " \-net" , " \-netns " <NETNS>
switches
.B bridge
to the specified network namespace
.IR NETNS .
Actually it just simplifies executing of:

.B ip netns exec
.IR NETNS
.B bridge
.RI "[ " OPTIONS " ] " OBJECT " { " COMMAND " | "
.BR help " }"

to

.B bridge
.RI "-n[etns] " NETNS " [ " OPTIONS " ] " OBJECT " { " COMMAND " | "
.BR help " }"

.TP
.BR "\-b", " \-batch " <FILENAME>
Read commands from provided file or standard input and invoke them.
First failure will cause termination of bridge command.

.TP
.BR "\-force"
Don't terminate bridge command on errors in batch mode.
If there were any errors during execution of the commands, the application
return code will be non zero.

.TP
.BR "\-json"
Display results in JSON format. Currently available for vlan and fdb.

.SH BRIDGE - COMMAND SYNTAX

.SS
.I OBJECT

.TP
.B link
- Bridge port.

.TP
.B fdb
- Forwarding Database entry.

.TP
.B mdb
- Multicast group database entry.

.TP
.B vlan
- VLAN filter list.

.SS
.I COMMAND

Specifies the action to perform on the object.
The set of possible actions depends on the object type.
As a rule, it is possible to
.BR "add" , " delete"
and
.B show
(or
.B list
) objects, but some objects do not allow all of these operations
or have some additional commands. The
.B help
command is available for all objects. It prints
out a list of available commands and argument syntax conventions.
.sp
If no command is given, some default command is assumed.
Usually it is
.B list
or, if the objects of this class cannot be listed,
.BR "help" .

.SH bridge link - bridge port

.B link
objects correspond to the port devices of the bridge.

.P
The corresponding commands set and display port status and bridge specific
attributes.

.SS bridge link set - set bridge specific attributes on a port

.TP
.BI dev " NAME "
interface name of the bridge port

.TP
.BI cost " COST "
the STP path cost of the specified port.

.TP
.BI priority " PRIO "
the STP port priority. The priority value is an unsigned 8-bit quantity
(number between 0 and 255). This metric is used in the designated port an
droot port selectio algorithms.

.TP
.BI state " STATE "
the operation state of the port. This is primarily used by user space STP/RSTP
implementation. One may enter a lowercased port state name, or one of the
numbers below. Negative inputs are ignored, and unrecognized names return an
error.

.B 0
- port is DISABLED. Make this port completely inactive.
.sp

.B 1
- STP LISTENING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on the bridge. In this
state the port listens for STP BPDUs and drops all other traffic frames.
.sp

.B 2
- STP LEARNING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on the bridge. In this
state the port will accept traffic only for the purpose of updating MAC
address tables.
.sp

.B 3
- STP FORWARDING state. Port is fully active.
.sp

.B 4
- STP BLOCKING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on the bridge. This state
is used during the STP election process. In this state, port will only process
STP BPDUs.
.sp

.TP
.BR "guard on " or " guard off "
Controls whether STP BPDUs will be processed by the bridge port. By default,
the flag is turned off allowed BPDU processing. Turning this flag on will
cause the port to stop processing STP BPDUs.

.TP
.BR "hairpin on " or " hairpin off "
Controls whether traffic may be send back out of the port on which it was
received. By default, this flag is turned off and the bridge will not forward
traffic back out of the receiving port.

.TP
.BR "fastleave on " or " fastleave off "
This flag allows the bridge to immediately stop multicast traffic on a port
that receives IGMP Leave message. It is only used with IGMP snooping is
enabled on the bridge. By default the flag is off.

.TP
.BR "root_block on " or " root_block off "
Controls whether a given port is allowed to become root port or not. Only used
when STP is enabled on the bridge. By default the flag is off.

.TP
.BR "learning on " or " learning off "
Controls whether a given port will learn MAC addresses from received traffic or
not. If learning if off, the bridge will end up flooding any traffic for which
it has no FDB entry. By default this flag is on.

.TP
.BR "learning_sync on " or " learning_sync off "
Controls whether a given port will sync MAC addresses learned on device port to
bridge FDB.

.TP
.BR "flooding on " or " flooding off "
Controls whether a given port will flood unicast traffic for which there is no FDB entry. By default this flag is on.

.TP
.BI hwmode
Some network interface cards support HW bridge functionality and they may be
configured in different modes. Currently support modes are:

.B vepa
- Data sent between HW ports is sent on the wire to the external
switch.

.B veb
- bridging happens in hardware.

.TP
.BR "mcast_flood on " or " mcast_flood off "
Controls whether a given port will be flooded with multicast traffic for which there is no MDB entry. By default this flag is on.

.TP
.BR "neigh_suppress on " or " neigh_suppress off "
Controls whether neigh discovery (arp and nd) proxy and suppression is enabled on the port. By default this flag is off.

.TP
.BR "vlan_tunnel on " or " vlan_tunnel off "
Controls whether vlan to tunnel mapping is enabled on the port. By default this flag is off.

.TP
.BI self
link setting is configured on specified physical device

.TP
.BI master
link setting is configured on the software bridge (default)

.TP
.BR "\-t" , " \-timestamp"
display current time when using monitor option.

.BR "bridge mdb add" .

.SS bridge mdb show - list multicast group database entries

This command displays the current multicast group membership table. The table
is populated by IGMP and MLD snooping in the bridge driver automatically. It
can be altered by
.B bridge mdb add
and
.B bridge mdb del
commands manually too.

.TP
.BI dev " DEV"

flag set).

.TP
.BI pvid
the vlan specified is to be considered a PVID at ingress.
Any untagged frames will be assigned to this VLAN.

.TP
.BI untagged
the vlan specified is to be treated as untagged on egress.

.TP
.BI self

.SS bridge vlan delete - delete a vlan filter entry
This command removes an existing vlan filter entry.

.PP
The arguments are the same as with
.BR "bridge vlan add".
The
.BR "pvid " and " untagged"
flags are ignored.

.SS bridge vlan show - list vlan configuration.

This command displays the current VLAN filter table.

.PP
With the
.B -statistics
option, the command displays per-vlan traffic statistics.

.SS bridge vlan tunnelshow - list vlan tunnel mapping.

This command displays the current vlan tunnel info mapping.

.SH bridge monitor - state monitoring

The
.B bridge
utility can monitor the state of devices and addresses
continuously. This option has a slightly different format.
Namely, the
.B monitor
command is the first in the command line and then the object list follows:

.BR "bridge monitor" " [ " all " |"
.IR OBJECT-LIST " ]"

.I OBJECT-LIST
is the list of object types that we want to monitor.
It may contain
.BR link ", " fdb ", and " mdb "."
If no
.B file
argument is given,
.B bridge
opens RTNETLINK, listens on it and dumps state changes in the format
described in previous sections.

.P
If a file name is given, it does not listen on RTNETLINK,
but opens the file containing RTNETLINK messages saved in binary format
and dumps them.

.SH NOTES
This command uses facilities added in Linux 3.0.

Although the forwarding table is maintained on a per-bridge device basis
the bridge device is not part of the syntax. This is a limitation of the
underlying netlink neighbour message protocol. When displaying the
forwarding table, entries for all bridges are displayed.
Add/delete/modify commands determine the underlying bridge device
based on the bridge to which the corresponding ethernet device is attached.
