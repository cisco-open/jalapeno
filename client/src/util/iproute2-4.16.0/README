How to compile this.
--------------------
1. libdbm

arpd needs to have the db4 development libraries. For Debian
users this is the package with a name like libdb4.x-dev.
DBM_INCLUDE points to the directory with db_185.h which
is the include file used by arpd to get to the old format Berkeley
database routines.  Often this is in the db-devel package.

2. make

The makefile will automatically build a config.mk file which
contains definitions of libraries that may or may not be available
on the system such as: ATM, ELF, MNL, and SELINUX.

3. To make documentation, cd to doc/ directory , then
   look at start of Makefile and set correct values for
   PAGESIZE=a4		, ie: a4 , letter ...	(string)
   PAGESPERPAGE=2	, ie: 1 , 2 ...		(numeric)
   and make there. It assumes, that latex, dvips and psnup
   are in your path.

4. This package includes matching sanitized kernel headers because
   the build environment may not have up to date versions. See Makefile
   if you have special requirements and need to point at different
   kernel include files.
